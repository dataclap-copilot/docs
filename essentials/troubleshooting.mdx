## Common Issues

### 1. Cannot Connect Cluster

**Symptoms:**
- Unable to establish connection to your Kubernetes cluster
- Connection timeout errors

**Solutions:**
- Ensure your kubeconfig file is correct and up to date
- Verify the cluster API server endpoint is accessible
- Check network connectivity between your machine and the Kubernetes API server
- Confirm that your firewall settings allow outbound connections to the cluster
- Validate that your credentials in the kubeconfig have not expired

---

### 2. Operator Deployment Fails

**Symptoms:**
- Operator pod fails to start
- Deployment errors in Kubernetes

**Solutions:**
- Verify you have the necessary permissions (RBAC) to deploy resources in the cluster
- Check for typos or missing fields in the YAML manifest file
- Ensure the namespace exists before deploying
- Review operator logs using `kubectl logs` for detailed error messages
- Confirm that required Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) are installed

### 3. Test Results Not Showing

**Symptoms:**
- Dashboard shows no test results
- Test execution completes but data is not visible

**Solutions:**
- Confirm the operator is running and healthy: `kubectl get pods -n <namespace>`
- Refresh the dashboard and clear your browser cache
- Check operator logs for any errors: `kubectl logs <operator-pod> -n <namespace>`
- Verify that the test configuration is correct
- Ensure network connectivity between the operator and the Kubetrace backend

### 6. Cluster Addition Problems

**Error Codes:** 403, 409, 500

**Solutions:**
- **Wrong kubeconfig (403):** Validate your kubeconfig file format and credentials
- **Cluster already added (409):** Check if the cluster is already registered in your account
- **Internal errors (500):** Wait a few moments and try again, or contact support

---

### 7. Topology View Issues

**Error Code:** 500

**Solutions:**
- Verify the selected cluster is connected and healthy
- Check if the cluster has network connectivity to the Kubetrace service
- Refresh the topology page
- Ensure the cluster operator is running properly
