## Onboard Your Cluster

Once you have selected your Cloud provider and Cluster, follow these steps to onboard your cluster:

### Prepare to Execute the Script

In Step 3 of the platform, copy the script for creating a Readonly Service Account and execute it. **Ensure all prerequisites are satisfied before running the script.**

#### Example: Execute Script in Azure

```sh
./kubetrace-azure.sh <cluster-name> <kubeconfig-output-path>
```

If you encounter errors such as:

```
(AuthorizationFailed) The client '57eada60-3d78-4de3-a599-93e8d7e4f' with object id '57eada60-3d78-4de3-a599-9db2a7e4f' does not have authorization to perform action
```

Follow the 4th prerequisite instruction for admin access or least privilege setup.

### Instructions for Admin to Set Up Non-Admin Access

#### 1️⃣ Create a Service Principal
```sh
az ad sp create-for-rbac --skip-assignment --name aks-test-nonadmin -o json > nonadmin-sp.json
```
This will output: `{ "appId": "xxx", "password": "yyy", "tenant": "zzz" }`

#### 2️⃣ Assign AKS Cluster User Role
```sh
az role assignment create \
  --assignee <appId-from-json> \
  --role "Azure Kubernetes Service Cluster User Role" \
  --scope $(az aks show -n <cluster-name> -g <resource-group> --query id -o tsv)
```

#### 3️⃣ Save and Apply RBAC YAML
Save the following as `kubetrace-rbac.yaml` and apply it:
```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: kubetrace-nonadmin
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["namespaces", "serviceaccounts", "serviceaccounts/token", "secrets", "pods", "events"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "create", "update"]
- apiGroups: ["rbac.authorization.k8s.io"]
  resources: ["clusterroles", "clusterrolebindings"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "create"]
- apiGroups: ["apps"]
  resources: ["deployments", "replicasets"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "create", "update"]
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: kubetrace-nonadmin-binding
subjects:
- kind: User
  name: "<appId-from-json>"
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
roleRef:
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: kubetrace-nonadmin
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```
Apply with:
```sh
kubectl apply -f kubetrace-rbac.yaml
```

#### 4️⃣ Share Credentials
Send the appId, password, and tenant from step 1 to the non-admin user.

### Instructions for Non-Admin User

#### 5️⃣ Login with Service Principal
```sh
az login --service-principal -u <appId> -p <password> --tenant <tenant>
```

#### 6️⃣ Get Cluster Credentials
```sh
az aks get-credentials -n <cluster-name> -g <resource-group> --overwrite-existing
```

#### 7️⃣ Apply Operator YAML
```sh
kubectl apply -f operator.yaml
```

#### 8️⃣ Rerun the Script
```sh
./kubetrace.sh <cluster-name> ./readonly-kubeconfig.yaml
```

### Final Steps in Kubetrace Platform

1. After executing the scripts, copy the `kubeconfig.yaml` and paste it into Step 4 of the Kubetrace platform.
2. In Step 5, select the discovered cluster, click **Add Cluster**, and generate the Kubetrace operator.
3. In Step 6, copy the generated Kubetrace operator `config.yaml` and execute:
   ```sh
   kubectl apply -f kubetrace-operator.yaml
   ```
4. Make sure the operator is running properly:
  ```sh
  kubectl get pods -n kubetrace-readonly
  ```

## Get started in three steps

Get your documentation site running locally and make your first customization.

### Step 1: Set up your local environment

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="copy" title="Clone your docs locally">
    During the onboarding process, you created a GitHub repository with your docs content if you didn't already have one. You can find a link to this repository in your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).
    
    To clone the repository locally so that you can make and preview changes to your docs, follow the [Cloning a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) guide in the GitHub docs.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="rectangle-terminal" title="Start the preview server">
    1. Install the Mintlify CLI: `npm i -g mint`
    2. Navigate to your docs directory and run: `mint dev`
    3. Open `http://localhost:3000` to see your docs live!
    
    <Tip>Your preview updates automatically as you edit files.</Tip>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 2: Deploy your changes

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="github" title="Install our GitHub app">
    Install the Mintlify GitHub app from your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/organization/github-app).
    
    Our GitHub app automatically deploys your changes to your docs site, so you don't need to manage deployments yourself.
</Accordion>
<Accordion icon="palette" title="Update your site name and colors">
    For a first change, let's update the name and colors of your docs site.

    1. Open `docs.json` in your editor.
    2. Change the `"name"` field to your project name.
    3. Update the `"colors"` to match your brand.
    4. Save and see your changes instantly at `http://localhost:3000`.

    <Tip>Try changing the primary color to see an immediate difference!</Tip>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 3: Go live

<Accordion icon="rocket" title="Publish your docs">
  1. Commit and push your changes.
  2. Your docs will update and be live in moments!
</Accordion>
